"A cooking website sells cooking equipment. They want to improve their product page. The product page has a rail with media (images or videos). Up until now, they have had a horizontal rail, a UX designer suggested having a vertical one. As a data analyst in the company, you suggested doing an AB test. You now have the results of the test and need to advise the company on whether they should ship the feature (vertical media rail) or not."

Given our business ask to compare the performance of a control and experimental version of a product placement, we’ve chosen to conduct an A/B test to statistically analyze results. Our goal is to determine whether. the control, or variant A (the horizontal media rail) or the experiment, variant B (the new vertical rail) result in an increase of our desired metrics. 

Based on our results, we’ll  then determine whether to ship the vertical. rail feature, and continuously monitor results for a given period of time to determine further  performance.
