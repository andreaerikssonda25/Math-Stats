A cooking website sells cooking equipment. They want to improve their product page. The product page has a rail with media (images or videos). Up until now, they have had a horizontal rail, a UX designer suggested having a vertical one. As a data analyst in the company, you suggested doing an AB test. You now have the results of the test and need to advise the company on whether they should ship the feature (vertical media rail) or not.
